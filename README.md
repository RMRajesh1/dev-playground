## JavaScript Projects

A collection of small JavaScript games and applications built during my **early learning phase (mid / late 2020 – early 2021)**.  
This was the period when I **started learning programming**, and these projects were created purely out of **self-interest and curiosity** while exploring how things work on the web.

Each folder contains a **standalone project** built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

These projects helped me practice and understand:
- JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Game logic and UI interactions
- Building applications without frameworks

All JavaScript projects are listed and accessible from a single **overview / launcher page**:
